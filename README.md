# Vertex Model


The vertex model uses polygons, composed of vertices and edges, to illustrate the mechanics in formation of polygon sheets. This model has successfully been applied to fly wings and eyes in 2D.  

Simulations compute the energy and forces in the system using the following equations:

E = 0.5 &Sigma;<sub>&alpha;</sub> K<sub>&alpha;</sub> (A<sub> &alpha; </sub> - A<sub>&alpha;</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + &Sigma;<sub> i,j </sub> &Lambda;<sub>i,j</sub> l<sub> i,j</sub>	+ 0.5 &Sigma;<sub> &alpha; </sub> &Gamma;<sub><&alpha;</sub> P<sub>&alpha;</sub><sup>2</sup>

where A is the area and P is the perimeter. 

F = - &nabla; &#8407;<sub>i</sub>E<sub>i</sub>


The terms represent cell elasticity, line tension and contraction, respectively.
